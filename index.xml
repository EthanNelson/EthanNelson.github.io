      <description>Inspired by this article by the New York Times, in which home decor and consumer news writer Michelle Higgins tells us about ways to spy on your dogs, I took a look at how much Americans spend on their domestic animals each year.
Americans are set to spend more on their pets in 2018 then they have in any of the past 16 years. Collectively, Americans are expected to spend more than $72 billion this year according to data from the American Pet Products Association.</description>

      <description>Text Mining the Poetry of World War I
Nov. 11, 2018 marks the 100th year since World War I ended. Soldiers, mostly educated British officers, transformed war poetry through uncompromisingly realistic depictions of life in the trenches. Poets like Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves, and Wilfred Owen, for one the first times in history, depicted war in horrific, dark language. An analysis using R&amp;rsquo;s tidy text library shows how they wrote about their experiences.</description>

      <description>An interactive map of the location quotient of select place name components by county. This is not an exhaustive list of place names, but it does show some neat patterns.

      <title>Equity-strapped sellers in Twin Cities keep starter homes in short supply</title>

      <description>This is a story that wasn&amp;rsquo;t heavy on visuals, but needed some heavy lifting in terms of data analysis. To help Jim Buchta, the Star Tribune&amp;rsquo;s real estate reporter, I wrote a python script using the pandas library to manipulate Minnesota Realtors data into a format that was easy to work with. From there, I used SQL and Excel to analyze the data.</description>

      <title>Black coaches vanish from Big Ten basketball, once a model for diversity</title>

      <description>In 2017, there were no nonwhite men&amp;rsquo;s basketball coaches in the Big Ten, the first time that had happened since the &amp;lsquo;80s. This is a story exploring the historical racial makeup in men&amp;rsquo;s college basketball. I did the analysis and made the graphics for this story by college basketball beat reporter Marcus Fuller. This story won an award from the National Association of Black Journalists.</description>

      <title>High school football participation declining — but not just because of concussions</title>

      <description>Since 2003, the number of schools fielding 11-man football teams has held steady, but the number of players has dropped by about 4,000, according to data from the National Federation of State High School Associations. This is a story I wrote for the Minneapolis Star Tribune&amp;rsquo;s Data Drop feature, a series in which reporters explain the news via data and graphics, à la the New York Times&amp;rsquo; The Upshot.</description>

      <description>After near-record numbers, average Gophers football attendance fell in 2016. The team&amp;rsquo;s coach chalked it up to the Gophs&amp;rsquo; poor record. I used a static graphic made with d3.js to explain the trend for the Minnesota Daily.

      <description>After a report accused the University of Minnesota of administrative bloat, the school planned to cut millions in spending. This is a story I helped explain with data analysis and a d3.js graphic with MN Daily reporter Kevin Beckman</description>
