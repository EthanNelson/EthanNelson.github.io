      <description>Inspired by this article by the New York Times, in which home decor and consumer news writer Michelle Higgins tells us about ways to spy on your dogs, I took a look at how much Americans spend on their domestic animals each year.
Americans are set to spend more on their pets in 2018 then they have in any of the past 16 years. Collectively, Americans are expected to spend more than $72 billion this year according to data from the American Pet Products Association.</description>

      <description>In 2017, there were no nonwhite men&amp;rsquo;s basketball coaches in the Big Ten, the first time that had happened since the &amp;lsquo;80s. This is a story exploring the historical racial makeup in men&amp;rsquo;s college basketball. I did the analysis and made the graphics for this story by college basketball beat reporter Marcus Fuller. This story won an award from the National Association of Black Journalists.</description>
