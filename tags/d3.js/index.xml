      <description>Inspired by this article by the New York Times, in which home decor and consumer news writer Michelle Higgins tells us about ways to spy on your dogs, I took a look at how much Americans spend on their domestic animals each year.
Americans are set to spend more on their pets in 2018 then they have in any of the past 16 years. Collectively, Americans are expected to spend more than $72 billion this year according to data from the American Pet Products Association.</description>

      <description>An interactive map of the location quotient of select place name components by county. This is not an exhaustive list of place names, but it does show some neat patterns.

      <title>Black coaches vanish from Big Ten basketball, once a model for diversity</title>

      <description>In 2017, there were no nonwhite men&amp;rsquo;s basketball coaches in the Big Ten, the first time that had happened since the &amp;lsquo;80s. This is a story exploring the historical racial makeup in men&amp;rsquo;s college basketball. I did the analysis and made the graphics for this story by college basketball beat reporter Marcus Fuller. This story won an award from the National Association of Black Journalists.</description>

      <description>After near-record numbers, average Gophers football attendance fell in 2016. The team&amp;rsquo;s coach chalked it up to the Gophs&amp;rsquo; poor record. I used a static graphic made with d3.js to explain the trend for the Minnesota Daily.
