      <description>National Security Advisor John Bolton recently unveiled the Trump administration&amp;rsquo;s new strategy in Africa. It&amp;rsquo;s in part designed to counter the influence of Chinese investment in the continent. Below is a d3.js graphic exploring the trend. This graphic uses data from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies&amp;rsquo; China Africa Research Initiative

      <description>Inspired by this article by the New York Times, in which home decor and consumer news writer Michelle Higgins tells us about ways to spy on your dogs, I took a look at how much Americans spend on their domestic animals each year.
Americans are set to spend more on their pets in 2018 then they have in any of the past 16 years. Collectively, Americans are expected to spend more than $72 billion this year according to data from the American Pet Products Association.</description>

      <description>Text Mining the Poetry of World War I
Nov. 11, 2018 marks the 100th year since World War I ended. Soldiers, mostly educated British officers, transformed war poetry through uncompromisingly realistic depictions of life in the trenches. Poets like Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves, and Wilfred Owen, for one the first times in history, depicted war in horrific, dark language. An analysis using R&amp;rsquo;s tidy text library shows how they wrote about their experiences.</description>

      <description>This is a story that wasn&amp;rsquo;t heavy on visuals, but needed some heavy lifting in terms of data analysis. To help Jim Buchta, the Star Tribune&amp;rsquo;s real estate reporter, I wrote a python script using the pandas library to manipulate Minnesota Realtors data into a format that was easy to work with. From there, I used SQL and Excel to analyze the data.</description>

      <description>In 2017, there were no nonwhite men&amp;rsquo;s basketball coaches in the Big Ten, the first time that had happened since the &amp;lsquo;80s. This is a story exploring the historical racial makeup in men&amp;rsquo;s college basketball. I did the analysis and made the graphics for this story by college basketball beat reporter Marcus Fuller. This story won an award from the National Association of Black Journalists.</description>

      <description>After near-record numbers, average Gophers football attendance fell in 2016. The team&amp;rsquo;s coach chalked it up to the Gophs&amp;rsquo; poor record. I used a static graphic made with d3.js to explain the trend for the Minnesota Daily.</description>
