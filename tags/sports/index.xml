      <description>In 2017, there were no nonwhite men&amp;rsquo;s basketball coaches in the Big Ten, the first time that had happened since the &amp;lsquo;80s. This is a story exploring the historical racial makeup in men&amp;rsquo;s college basketball. I did the analysis and made the graphics for this story by college basketball beat reporter Marcus Fuller. This story won an award from the National Association of Black Journalists.</description>

      <description>Since 2003, the number of schools fielding 11-man football teams has held steady, but the number of players has dropped by about 4,000, according to data from the National Federation of State High School Associations. This is a story I wrote for the Minneapolis Star Tribune&amp;rsquo;s Data Drop feature, a series in which reporters explain the news via data and graphics, à la the New York Times&amp;rsquo; The Upshot.</description>

      <description>After near-record numbers, average Gophers football attendance fell in 2016. The team&amp;rsquo;s coach chalked it up to the Gophs&amp;rsquo; poor record. I used a static graphic made with d3.js to explain the trend for the Minnesota Daily.</description>
